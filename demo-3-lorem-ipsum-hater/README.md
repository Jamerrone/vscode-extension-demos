# Demo 3: Lorem Ipsum Hater

<img align="center" src="./banner.png">

For this third demo, we are going to build an HTML Lorem Ipsum Hater. It will highlight every instance of the world "lorem" and each sentence where the word was found. This demo was quite complex to build and a lot of research was needed from my side to get it working the way I wanted/expected.

The format for this demo/guide will also be a bit different than the previous ones. There is just a lot more code we need to get through so there will be less talking and more step by step instructions. There will be a lot of new functionality we did not discuss before so make sure you understand every new concept before continuing. I had a lot of fun getting everything working together so I hope you guys learn something from it.
